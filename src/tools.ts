//   • PURPOSE — one clear action sentence.
//   • USAGE — when to use this vs sibling tools (read8 vs read16 vs read_range,
//     write* vs load_state, frame_advance vs unpause, etc.).
//   • BEHAVIOR — side effects, error conditions, destructive notes. Reads say
//     "no side effects — pure read." Writes say "DESTRUCTIVE: overwrites".
//     Every tool documents the failure mode it can return (unknown domain,
//     out-of-range address, oversize range, missing capability, etc.).
//   • RETURNS — exact shape of the success output.
//
// Each parameter has a `description` that adds context the schema can't
// (interactions, examples, units, alignment requirements).
